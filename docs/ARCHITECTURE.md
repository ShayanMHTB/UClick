# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

UClick follows a modern mobile-first architecture using a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) approach with Supabase, enabling rapid development while maintaining scalability and security.

## Tech Stack Details

### Frontend Architecture

**Ionic Framework + React**

- Cross-platform mobile development with native performance
- Single codebase for iOS, Android, and Progressive Web App
- React for component-based UI development and state management

**Framework7**

- Material Design components for native mobile feel
- Pre-built responsive screens and UI elements
- Consistent design system across platforms

**Capacitor**

- Native mobile API access (Camera, GPS, Push Notifications)
- Plugin ecosystem for device-specific functionality
- Bridge between web technologies and native mobile features

### Backend Architecture

**Supabase (Primary Backend)**

- PostgreSQL database with automatic API generation
- Built-in authentication with JWT tokens
- Real-time subscriptions via WebSockets
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data privacy
- Edge Functions for custom business logic

**Alternative/Complementary Services**

- NestJS (optional) for complex business logic
- Socket.io (fallback) for real-time messaging if needed

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

**Authentication System**

- Supabase Auth integration
- JWT token management
- Social login support (Google, Facebook)
- Email/password authentication

**User Management**

- Profile management
- Privacy controls
- Verification system

**Service Layer**

## Data Architecture

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Supabase)

**Core Tables:**

- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `services` - Service listings
- `items` - Marketplace items
- `events` - Local events
- `bookings` - Service bookings
- `messages` - Chat messages
- `reviews` - Ratings and reviews

**Security:**

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User-based data access control
- Encrypted sensitive data

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
